
# Version 1.4-3

- HTML.matrix and HTML.data.frame now can use several new output options
  as they call now format. This allows using a comma "," as decimal
  separator for example.
  
- HTML.data.frame now has a sortableDF option. When using it, a link to
  an external behavior file is done (suggestion by Tom Short, could be
  used by Rpad)

- Available options that user may want to change:
	R2HTML.sortableDF  		(FALSE)
	R2HTML.format.digits  		(2)
	R2HTML.format.nsmall  		(0)
	R2HTML.format.big.mark		("")
	R2HTML.format.big.interval	(3)
	R2HTML.format.decimal.mark=	(Sys.localeconv()[["decimal_point"]])

- For data.frames, those optins could be applied for the whole data.frame 
  or column by column. For this, one can use a vector argument (same size
  as the number of columns).

- Bugs fixed: HTML.table

Following modifications contributed by Philippe Grosjean 

- Now uses NAMESPACE 

- Renamed .First.lib() into .onLoad()

- In RweaveHTMLSetup(), commented if(!require(R2HTML))
      stop("R2HTML package is required."). 
  This is not useful, becasue this function IS in R2HTML package!!!

- Changed utils:::XXX and utils::XXX into XXX everywhere, and added
  import(utils) in NAMESPACE instead.

# 19/10/2004 - Version 1.4-3

- HTML.matrix and HTML.data.frame now can use several new output options
  as they call now 'format. This allows using a comma "," as decimal
  separator for example. All 'format' arguments are allowed and can be used
  as a single element (value applies to all columns) or a vector (provide
  values for each column). - Suggestion by Arne Henningsen

- HTML.data.frame now has a sortableDF option. When using it, a link to
  an external DHTML behavior file is done (suggestion by Tom Short, could be
  used by it's wonderful Rpad)

- Available options that user may want to change 
 (default for every   matrix/DF):
	R2HTML.sortableDF  		(FALSE)
	R2HTML.format.digits  		(2)
	R2HTML.format.nsmall  		(0)
	R2HTML.format.big.mark		("")
	R2HTML.format.big.interval	(3)
	R2HTML.format.decimal.mark=	(Sys.localeconv()[["decimal_point"]])

- Bug fixed: HTML.table

Following modifications contributed by Philippe Grosjean 

- Now uses NAMESPACE 

- Renamed .First.lib() into .onLoad()

- In RweaveHTMLSetup(), commented if(!require(R2HTML))
      stop("R2HTML package is required."). 
  This is not useful, becasue this function IS in R2HTML package!!!

- Changed utils:::XXX and utils::XXX into XXX everywhere, and added
  import(utils) in NAMESPACE instead.
